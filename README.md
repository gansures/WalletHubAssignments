# Quick notes on Assignment1:
1. The tests cover posting Hello world but also it deletes the duplicate post and re-posts the message.
2. Validations are added for every action performed.
3. No hard coding used, the data can be fed to the test cases through GlobalSettings.properties file.
4. Works for any login if data modified on the properties file.
5. There seems to be some certification issue running through testng.xml. It may not happen to you. Incase it does, for now run as TestNG from Assignment1.java
6. Compatibility issues with versions of IE, Chrome and Gecko hence the drivers copies are added to the project. if not the idea was to use the runtime driver through driver manager

# Quick notes on Assignment2:
1. The code is designed only specifically for a new post.
2. No hard coding used, the data can be fed to the test cases through GlobalSettings.properties file.
3. Works for any login if data modified on the properties file.
4. Given the right data in properties file, it works in order to review any entity not just Test Insurance company. Tested as well
5. As the code is designed to work for only new post, Couldn't attach the result. Please feel free modify either Test data or the login details to test the code stability.
